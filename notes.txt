Things I'm learning during this little project
    - find . -maxdepth 1 -name '*.filetype' (this helps to find particular files in the present top level directory and no sub-directories - bash)

    - find . -maxdepth 1 -name '*.csv' &&  mv $_ csv_files (moving all relevant csv files into csv_files directory - bash)

    -git reset --hard master@{"10 minutes ago"} (reseting git to a specific point in time - git)



Things to do next in the project
    # Tables to make - main tables
    # transaction description (td_id(PK), td_name)
    # purchases - (purchase_id(PK), td_id(FK), amount spent, season, percentage of current balance)
    # processed files - (file_id(PK), file_name)

    # objective of this task is to find out which places/people have been getting the most of my money 
    and to also observe and do something about my spending habits

    # add season to each row so that we can group by season later in sql

    # THINGS TO ANALYZE - create tables by selecting from main tables

    # .day in week where I spend the most money
    # .season where I spend the most money
    # .average amount of money spent per month over the years
    # .places where I spent the most money
    # .places where I shopped the most
